Requests WPHTTP Adapter
=======================

What is this?
-------------
As just a proof of concept, I decided to whip up a plugin that replaces WP HTTP
with Requests, but maintains 100% API compatibility *and* can live as a plugin.

This is that plugin.


How do I use it?
----------------

	$ git clone git@github.com:rmccue/Requests-WPHTTP.git requests-wphttp
	$ composer install
